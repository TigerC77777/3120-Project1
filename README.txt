Project 1

In Project 1, we were asked to implement a solution to the Josephus Problem
using an array-based linked list with two separate methods, alongside a third
implementation of our choice. The array-based linked list had implementations
using a deleteValue method, which searched for a value to remove the node, and
a deleteNode method, which took the node and its previous node and directly
removed the node. The third method used was the provided linked list that was
created in-class.

As a separate note, each implementation has its own Makefile which is located
in its respective folder.
